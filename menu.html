		<h3>Chocolate Chip Cookies</h3>

		<p style="font-size: 80%"> In his work titled “The Concept of Autonomy”, Gerald Dworkin offers his take on the theory of autonomy by first giving the criteria necessary for a “satisfactory theory” (55). Dworkin states that a successful theory will be logically consistent, empirically possible (it must be possible to achieve autonomy), it must demonstrate that autonomy is inherently good, and it must be neutral across different ideological platforms.</p>

	<h3>Zucchini Bread</h3>
	<p style="font-size: 80%; font-family:courier">Throughout the entirety of this piece, Dworkin defines and develops both of these ideas and explains why the two are inherently necessary for a person to obtain autonomy.According to Dworkin’s definition, authenticity is a matter of acting in a way that is aligned with the desires of one’s “true self” (59). He gives the example of the reluctant smoker who continues to smoke due to his prolonged addiction, although his true self wishes to quit the habit for good.</p>

	<h3>Pumpkin Bread</h3>
	<p style="font-size: 40%">Were he to wish that tobacco would nauseate him from now on, his decision to quit smoking would not be voluntary but it would be authentic because his true self wishes to quit; the influence is “his”. Dworkin also gives the example of the envious skier. When this individual recognizes that his true motivation for wanting to learn how to ski is his envy of his athletic brother, he can either desire to be motivated by another means or he can act authentically by accepting the desire as his own. </p>

	<h3>PB and J</h3>
	<p style="font-size: 80%">Dworkin then goes on to explain the idea of procedural independence. A person is said to exhibit procedural independence with respect to their motivations if the desire which causes them to act has not been produced by any sort of manipulation or deception. In Dworkin’s case, he means that an individual’s second-level desires should have as little influence from others as possible. He does, however, point out that it is inevitable that individuals adopt certain societal norms and ideals from the communities around them, implying that it is impossible to elevate all influence from a person’s life. </p>
